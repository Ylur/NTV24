2.Create a method called "addItemToList" that takes an item as input and adds it to the list.
Create a menu system that allows the user to choose between adding an item to the list, viewing the list, or ending the program.
If the user chooses to add an item, prompt them for the item name and call the "addItemToList" method to add it to the list.
If the user chooses to view the list, display the contents of the list.
If the user chooses to end the program, exit the menu loop and end the program.
Extra challenge - Remove an item from the list
